To install Rift Realms, go to the **Releases** section, download the **launcher**, and run it to set everything up automatically. The launcher handles all the files for you, making it easy to start exploring the new dimensions right away.

Sometimes antivirus programs might flag it as a virus, but this is a **false positive** caused by how the launcher loads assets and runs background processes. Rift Realms is completely safe, **open source**, and **free to play**, so anyone can check the code themselves to confirm itâ€™s clean and trustworthy.

AND HAVE FUN!
